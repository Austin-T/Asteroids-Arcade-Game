# Asteroids-Arcade-Game
"Asteroids" is a retro-style arcade game created using pygame. This game was developed as a part of a 4-hour coding challenge. 

In Aseroids, a player must pilot a space ship through a field of incoming space rock. By using the left and right arrow keys, the user can 
move the ship across the window, dodging asteroids. By pressing the space-bar the user can fire lasers to destroy incoming asteroids. 
Points are awarded to the user for each asteroid that is destroyed. The game ends when an incoming asteroid colides with the space ship.

All code, excluding that which is contained in 'graphic_support_mod.py', was created by myself for the purpose of completing the 4-hour 
code challenge. Comments (and docstrings) were added to the file after the challenge in order to make the code easily readable. The space 
ship images are provided through 'fourjay.org'. Explosion animations are courtesy of Adiel Ribeiro. Laser images have been provided 
through 'rock-cafe.info'. The asteroid images have been provided through 'pixelartmaker.com'.

All code is avalable under 'GNU General Public License v3.0'. Enjoy!
